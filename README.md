# FencingClubImagery
This is all the images and material I've made for the Fencing club over the 3 years as a committee member


All of these images are produced using InkScape, and I'm very grateful for its existance.

## Structure
I have done my best to save both the original SVG, PDFs and pngs, where
* Finished Products contains PNGs and PDFs 
    * also contains text signs used throughout the year
* svgs contains svgs and relevant material (eg reference images)


## How I make them
My general process has been:
* decide the image content and layout
* find reference images (usually photos I've taken myself)
* trace over complex things, freehand the rest
* compose using the Club's Design guide
    * use Rockwell for titles
    * Futura for headers
    * A rounded sans-serif font for the rest, usually a roboto 
    * use the university's [official palette](https://www.stir.ac.uk/brand-bank/visual-assets/colour-palette/)
* Assemble in a neat composition
* place over the main page (viewPort?) of the svg
* export as a PDF for future use, and export as a PNG for immediate use
* when printing is involved, I tend to merge things in a single PDF so it's easier to print all together and it saves paper


## Why this?
I love making graphics, and I started out by making fonts for Conlangs.
These images are not perfect by any means, but I'm very proud of them anyway.
I hope once I leave the committee, the graphics will be reused.
